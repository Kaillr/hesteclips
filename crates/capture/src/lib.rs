//! Capture backend abstraction.
//!
//! macOS uses `sck` (ScreenCaptureKit + VideoToolbox), Windows uses `win`
//! (Windows Graphics Capture + Media Foundation + WASAPI), both behind the same
//! `Recorder` trait so the app never depends on which one is live. Mics come
//! from cpal everywhere and are mixed in `mixer`. Linux has no recorder yet.
